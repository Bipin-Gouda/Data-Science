1. What is  PCA : Principle Component Analysis : 
ans: It is a dimensionality reduction technique -Done (just like regression Bestline,MSE,Finds which columns 
more important and when )

2. knn imputer : Done

3. What is Gridsearch CV , its use ?
Ans: GridSearchCV is a technique for finding the optimal parameter values from a given set of parameters in a grid.
It's essentially a cross-validation technique. The model as well as the parameters must be entered. After extracting
the best parameter values, predictions are made

4. Kfold Cross validation

5. KNN, best k value selection 

6. Parameter vs Hyperparameter


NOTE: 
Strictly participate in kaggle discussions 
make notebooks Sundar put some effort on it


NOTE
sklearn linear regression doesnt use Gradient Descent
Ridge and Lasso use Gradient Descent by default in sklearn ( they use Stochastic Gradient Descent)
